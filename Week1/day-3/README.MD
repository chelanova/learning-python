# File Stats Analyzer

A Python project to analyze file statistics with proper error handling implementation.

## 📚 What I Learned (Day 3)

### Error Handling
- **Basic Error Handling**
  - `try-except` blocks
  - Catching specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, etc.)
  - `finally` clause for cleanup operations
  
- **Multiple Exceptions**
  - Handling different exception types
  - Using multiple `except` blocks
  - Catching multiple exceptions in one block
  
- **Custom Exceptions**
  - Creating custom exception classes
  - Inheriting from `Exception` base class
  - Raising custom exceptions with meaningful messages

## 🚀 Project: File Stats Analyzer

### Features
- Analyze file properties (size, extension, line count, word count)
- Robust error handling for various file operations
- Custom exceptions for specific error cases
- User-friendly error messages
- Support for different file types




## 🔜 Next Steps (Day 4)
- CSV Operations project
- Working with CSV parsing using `csv` module or `pandas`
- Data manipulation and analysis

## 💡 Key Concepts Applied
- **Error Handling Best Practices**
  - Always use context managers for file operations
  - Catch specific exceptions, not generic ones
  - Provide meaningful error messages
  - Clean up resources properly

- **Custom Exceptions**
  - Created domain-specific exceptions
  - Improved code readability and debugging

## 📝 Notes
Built with AI assistance as part of my learning journey. Each concept was understood and implemented with hands-on practice.
